# HR Management System - Java Backend

This project was done during my internship as a Java Backend Developer at Kuehne+Nagel. It is a robust HR Management System that leverages various technologies, including Java, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL. Below, I have outlined my contributions to the project and the key features implemented:

## Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL

## Contributions

### CRUD Operations
I was responsible for the development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for job titles. This functionality allows efficient management of job titles within the HR system.

### Pagination
To optimize the user experience and enhance data retrieval efficiency, I introduced pagination. This feature ensures that users can navigate through large datasets effortlessly.

### Validation
To maintain data accuracy and integrity, I implemented robust validation mechanisms for both Create and Edit API operations. This ensures that only valid data is processed by the system.

### Swagger Documentation (OpenAPI 3)
I integrated Swagger, which provides comprehensive documentation for the system's APIs. This enhances the usability of the APIs and simplifies the development process.

### Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito, Spy)
I actively contributed to the creation and maintenance of unit tests. This rigorous testing approach ensures the reliability and stability of the system.

### Dynamic Employee Search
I played a key role in implementing dynamic employee search functionality using dynamic queries and specifications. This feature enables users to perform advanced and flexible searches within the HR system.

### Excel File Handling
To streamline data management and reporting, I implemented data export and import capabilities. This allows users to work with HR data more efficiently through Excel files.
